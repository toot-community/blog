Hey everyone. üëã

I hope everyone is doing well in the new year. I'd like to provide a quick update of our current financial situation and
provide some insight into the recently made changes.

## Changes made to toot.community

* We're now sending emails through Amazon SES instead of Mailgun. They're significantly cheaper.
* We've moved from DigitalOcean Spaces to Cloudflare R2. Although they're more expensive, they provide a better
  experience. We've seen people experiencing issues with uploading their media. This should be fixed now.
* We've started an ActivityPub relay over at https://relay.toot.community. It's private and invite-only. I've reached
  out to some admins, and there are currently about ¬±175.000 active people filling this relay. This is great for
  improving content discovery for all instances involved.

\* We've paid for Cloudflare (Caching Proxy / Anti-DDoS) in advance for the next 12 months. This is why the expenses
appear higher in December.
